"""
Accessibility API Text Extractor
Extracts structured text from the active window using OS accessibility APIs.
This is MORE accurate than OCR because it reads actual UI element text directly.

Falls back gracefully if the window doesn't support accessibility (games, remote desktop).

This module now delegates to the platform_support adapter for cross-platform
compatibility. The API (A11yExtractor class) remains identical.

    Extracts text from the foreground window using OS accessibility APIs.

    Advantages over OCR:
    - 100% accurate text (reads actual rendered text, no misreads)
    - Instant (<0.5s vs 8-15s for OCR)
    - Structured (knows what's a button vs a label vs a message)
    - Zero GPU/CPU cost

    Limitations:
    - Doesn't work on: games, remote desktop, some Electron apps, images
    - Only captures the ACTIVE window (not the full screen)
